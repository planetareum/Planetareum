# Planetareum
Thanks to brilliant minds around the world today and technological breakthroughs, we now have the bleeding edge technical solutions to solve global problems. By connecting augmented reality, blockchain, GIS, GPS and a new hybrid PoW system that involves both digital and physical tasks, we are now able to create a regenrative road map for the entire Earth and micro manage on a personal scale to implement solutions.

Technology is advancing at break neck speed in every field of science. Perhaps the most notable of technological advance in 2017 is the Blockchain called Ethereum that brought together dozens of the largest companies in the world to the ConsenSys Summit held by the Enterprize Ethereum Alliance (EEA). Several other long awaited technologies have been entering mainstream consumer channels such as personal drones, Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). These fields of cutting edge technology are about to change our lives forever. 

The Planetareum Project is being developed as an open source project for the benefit of the global community. Pushing the boundaries in several state-of-the-art fields of applied sciences. 
Participation is the Planetareum Project is highly encouraged. Commits and general feedback are valued and will be rewarded at such time that the Planetareum Public Blockchain reaches ICO.
