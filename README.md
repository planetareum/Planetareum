# Planetareum
Thanks to brilliant minds around the world today creating technological breakthroughs, we now have the bleeding edge technical solutions to solve global problems. By connecting augmented reality, blockchain, GIS, GPS, drones and a new hybrid PoW system that involves both digital and physical tasks, we are now able to create a regenerative road map for the entire Earth and micro manage on a personal scale to implement solutions.

Technology is advancing at break neck speed in every field of science. Perhaps the most notable of technological advance in 2017 is the Blockchain called Ethereum that brought together dozens of the largest companies in the world to the ConsenSys Summit held by the Enterprize Ethereum Alliance (EEA). Several other long awaited technologies have been entering mainstream consumer channels such as personal drones, Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). These fields of cutting edge technology are about to change our lives forever. 

The Planetareum Project is open source for the benefit of the global community. Pushing the boundaries in several state-of-the-art fields of applied sciences to realise our true human potential. 
Participation in the Planetareum Project is highly encouraged. Commits and general feedback are valued and will be rewarded at such time that the Planetareum Public Blockchain reaches ICO.

## What problems will Planetareum solve?
Food Security. Primarily the project aims to solve food security problems throughout the world. Even with all of the advances of the last 100 years there are still people going hungry every day in every country on earth. It's simply not acceptable any longer and has always been the cause of unnecessary suffering. 

Planetareum aims to deliver the instructions and resources required for people in any corner of the world to take control of their local environment and create an abundance of healthy organic food for themselves, their families and the wider community. The rise of industrial agriculture has diminished the ancient knowledge of creating regenerative and abundant landscapes that people, animals and plants thrive in. Due to the ongoing efforts of naturalists, regenerative agriculture and permaculture studies, that knowledge is now catalogued and available though the spread of this knowledge is slow and can be overwhelming to many people. Nature is very complicated, the symbiotic relationships between soil microbes, fungi, plants, animals and humans had to be relearned and documented in order for us to create an AI capable of mimicking a professional in this field.

Decentralization of food supplies is required in order to sustain human population growth now and going into the future. If we do not address this most vital aspect of our basic needs there will be much suffering and starvation in years to come. It could be argued that current industrial agriculture is capable of providing for all people but we know that's not true as we still have major food security problems. Creating localised food abundance is the right way.
